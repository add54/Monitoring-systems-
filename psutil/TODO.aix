AIX support is experimental at this time.
The following functions and methods are unsupported on the AIX platform:

    psutil.Process.memory_maps
    psutil.Process.num_ctx_switches

Known limitations:
    psutil.Process.io_counters read count is always 0
    reading basic process info may fail or return incorrect values when process is starting
        (see IBM APAR IV58499 - fixed in newer AIX versions)
    sockets and pipes may not be counted in num_fds (fixed in newer AIX versions)

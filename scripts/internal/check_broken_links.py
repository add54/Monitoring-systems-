Checks for broken links in file names specified as command line parameters.

There are a ton of a solutions available for validating URLs in string using
regex, but less for searching, of which very few are accurate.
This snippet is intended to just do the required work, and avoid complexities.
Django Validator has pretty good regex for validation, but we have to find
urls instead of validating them. (REFERENCES [7])
There's always room for improvement.

Method:
* Match URLs using regex (REFERENCES [1]])
* Some URLs need to be fixed, as they have < (or) > due to inefficient regex.
* Remove duplicates (because regex is not 100% efficient as of now).
* Check validity of URL, using HEAD request. (HEAD to save bandwidth)
  Uses requests module for others are painful to use. REFERENCES[9]
  Handles redirects, http, https, ftp as well.
